JIRA Push
=============
This plugins goal is to use the information gathered by the Report Generator plugin and send it to any object schema within JIRA Cloud.
The specific end point and different type of object can be set in the settings page.
It incorporates the Insight plugin within JIRA Cloud.
Thanks to Synergy Learning for the licence for JIRA Cloud and idea, in particular Peter Hinds.

Usage
=============
Once the plugin has been installed navigate to the local plugin in directory and select on the "JIRA Push" option.
From there you will be able to fill in the required fields which are based around the object schema.
You can run the API manually through the manual task runner or set it to be fired every day for example.
